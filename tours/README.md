## Reflection

This project was a test task, the main idea of ​​which is to test my basic programming skills, knowledge of styling and an idea of ​​​​how the candidate copes with the task.
I had project requirements that I fulfilled. Also, when clarifying the details, the representatives of the employer noted that only the requirements described in this assignment should be observed.

The original plan was to split the page elements into components and put everything together in the main file. However, I ran into a problem. Due to lack of experience, I planned the footer elements incorrectly. I had to write a component for 125 lines of code.
This file contains both buttons and a basket, pop-up elements.
I coped with the main task - the code works. However, it is worth working more carefully on planning and code cleanliness.

To stylize the project, I used the Swiper slider and Sass and SCSS and Surge to create a json database.
I think it makes more sense to use slider elements from the library than to write the code manually. Customizing a library item takes much less time and effort.
